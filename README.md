## HW 1 - N Puzzle solved with IDA*.
## HW 2 - N Queens solved with min-conflicts and good initialization. Program solves the problem for huge N(N>10000000). To print solutions change constant MAX_N in file to be bigger than the input otherwise only time required to find answer is printed.
## HW 3 - Travelling salesman problem solved with genetic algorithm.
## HW 4 - Tic-tac-toe solved with minimax algorithm(always plays optimally).
## HW 5 - Na√Øve Bayes classifier implementation.
## HW 6 - ID3 implementation.
## HW 7 - Clusterizaton using kMeans.
## HW 8 - Neural network solving boolean functions AND, OR and XOR using backpropagation.
